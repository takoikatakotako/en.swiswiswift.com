<br>

This is an important comment note that I use only occasionally in ReactNative.

Installing react-native-cli globally with npm  

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
react-native -v
```

Create a project  
Be careful not to use the same name as a Sample(react-native init Sample) or something else used internally such as ReactNative, because it seems to give an error.  

```
react-native init ReactNative
```

Launching the ios emulator.  

```
cd ReactNative
react-native run-ios
```
