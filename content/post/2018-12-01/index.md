Old article (Swift3) is here Getting JSON from the API using Alamofire

#Xcode 10.1  
#Swift 4.2  

This is a sample to get information from the weather API using Alamofire, a famous swift communication library, and SwiftyJSON, a famous swift JSON library.  
In this sample, the JSON is acquired asynchronously and an alert is displayed.  
Don't forget to set up the ATS as well.
