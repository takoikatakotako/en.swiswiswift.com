<br>

This is a sample of reading and writing a text file saved in an SD card with ESP32.  
I couldn't find much simple sample code on the net to read and write, so I drew it.  

I used this site as a reference for wiring between the SD card and ESP.  

And I used this code as a reference.  
Save data to SD card with Arduino
