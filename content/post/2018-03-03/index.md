What do I have to learn to make an iPhone app from? My friends often ask me, "What's the best way to study?", so I've put together some recommendations.  
I don't think there is a royal road to learning iPhone apps, but please refer to it if you like.  

1. study with books  
It is recommended that you study with books first.  
Web pages are often difficult to look back at, and information is often out of date, so it's still a good idea to transcribe a book first.  
All of the recent books are good books, so I think you can buy any of them, but the following books are especially recommended.  
Also, buy books that are appropriate for your environment (and new if possible).  
I'm pretty much settled in with Swift4, but the way to write Swift and the UI in Xcode are very different between versions.  
Watch out for Xcode for the first time.

2.Try to release the app.  
What a surprise! You may think, "I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'd recommend releasing an app once you've studied it in a book.  
It's my first app, so I'm making and releasing something really simple, a book app with a bit of fiddling. (Even if you don't actually release it, it's still up for review.)  
Apps that are too simple will be rejected by the judges, so give your app a twist.  
There are a lot of painful things like developer registration and screening, but it's a great learning experience.  
How do we get these features to happen? You are welcome to ask questions such as, "What is this?  
Please feel free to leave a comment in the comments section. (I'm having trouble with the lack of spoilers for my blog.)  


3.Memorize Cocoa Pods, use the library  
A library management tool called Pods is the de facto standard for iOS app development.  
Maybe it's closer to gem or npm or HomeBrew.  
If you add a library, you can easily create a cool UI or make the processing around the communication easier.  

I would be happy to help you with anything.
