New article (Swift4) is here. Using Alamofire to get JSON from the API (Swift4.2)  

This is a sample of retrieving information from the [weather API](http://weather.livedoor.com/weather_hacks/webservice) using [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), a famous swift communication library, and SwiftyJSON, another famous swift library for JSON.  
In this sample, the JSON is acquired asynchronously and an alert is displayed.
